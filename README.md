# Phone Stats

Setting up a background task on Android that works properly, 
setting up some monitoring of how much I use my phone to end up locally.

Uses [Tasker]() to write to a local file every 120s with the state of my screen + a few other things.

Tasker is then responsible for POSTing this file to an endpoint.
